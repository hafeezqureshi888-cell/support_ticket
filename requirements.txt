1. Support Ticket Form
The form lets customers log a support ticket by picking the issue type (e.g., Technical Issues, Billing,
or Feedback). When they click Submit, the system automatically files the ticket into the correct
MySQL database for that department so the right team sees it straight away.
● Basic input fields to get the information of a support ticket.
● Mandatory Form Field:
○ Ticket Type (Dropdown options):
■ Technical Issues
■ Account & Billing
■ Product & Service
■ General Inquiry
■ Feedback & Suggestions
➤ Logic:
● On submission, the ticket must be saved to the appropriate department's/types database
connection and tickets table.
● Each department has a separate MySQL database
2. Admin Panel (Single Login Access)
● Create a single login page for admin access (email/password).
● After login, the admin is redirected to a Ticket List page.
Ticket List Page:
● Use DataTables to display all tickets from all types.
● Fields to display
○ All tickets fields
○ Action (View button)
Ticket View Page:
● Show full ticket details.
● Provide a text editor (e.g., Trix, CKEditor) to allow the admin to compose a note to that Ticket
● Update ticket status as "Noted" after that.
🔧 Technical Guidelines
● Use Laravel 10+.
● Configure multiple database connections
● Optional: Use Seeder or a simple factory to create dummy candidates.
Plese use the same design and crate using Laravel and tailwindcss also please use the same database name and table name.
Admin Panel Login Credentials:
Email: admin@admin.com

Admin Panel Design should be responsive and modern.
